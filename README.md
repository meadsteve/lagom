## What
Lagom is a dependency injection container designed to give you "just enough"
help with building your dependencies. The intention is that almost
all of your code doesn't know about or rely on lagom. Lagom will
only be involved at the top level to pull everything together.

An example usage can be found here: [github.com/meadsteve/lagom-example-repo](https://github.com/meadsteve/lagom-example-repo)

## Installation
```bash
pip install lagom
# or: 
# pipenv install lagom
# poetry add lagom
```
## Usage
Everything in Lagom is based on types. To create an object
you pass the type to the container:
```python
container = Container()
some_thing = container[SomeClass]
```

### Defining a singleton
```python
container[SomeExpensiveToCreateClass] = SomeExpensiveToCreateClass("up", "left")
```
alternatively if you want to defer construction until it's needed:
```python
container[SomeExpensiveToCreateClass] = Singleton(SomeExpensiveToCreateClass)
```


### Defining a type that gets recreated every time
```python
container[SomeClass] = lambda: SomeClass("down", "spiral")
```
if the type needs things from the container the lambda can take a
single argument which is the container:
```python
container[SomeClass] = lambda c: SomeClass(c[SomeOtherDep], "spinning")
```

if your construction logic is longer than would fit in a lambda a
function can also be bound to the container:
```python
@dependency_definition(container)
def my_constructor() -> MyComplexDep:
    # Really long
    # stuff goes here
    return MyComplexDep(some_number=5)
```

### Defining an async loaded type
```python
@dependency_definition(container)
async def my_constructor() -> MyComplexDep:
    # await some stuff or any other async things
    return MyComplexDep(some_number=5)

my_thing = await container[Awaitable[MyComplexDep]]

```

### Alias a concrete instance to an ABC
```python
container[SomeAbc] = ConcreteClass
```

### Partially bind a function
Apply a function decorator to any function.
```python
@magic_bind_to_container(container)
def handle_some_request(request: typing.Dict, game: Game):
    # do something to the game
    pass
```

This function can now be called omitting any arguments 
that the container knows how to build.
```python
# we can now call the following. the game argument will automagically
# come from the container
handle_some_request(request={"roll_dice": 5})
```


### Invocation level caching
Suppose you have a function and you want all the dependencies
to share an instance of an object then you can define invocation
level shared dependencies.

```python

class ProfileLoader:
    def __init__(self, loader: DataLoader):
        pass

class AvatarLoader:
    def __init__(self, loader: DataLoader):
        pass

@magic_bind_to_container(container, shared=[DataLoader])
def handle_some_request(request: typing.Dict, profile: ProfileLoader, user_avatar: AvatarLoader):
    # do something to the game
    pass
```

now each invocation of handle_some_request will get the same instance
of loader so this class can cache values for the invocation lifetime.

### Alternative to decorator
The above example can also be used without a decorator if you want
to keep the pure unaltered function available for testing.

```python
def handle_some_request(request: typing.Dict, game: Game):
    pass

# This new function can be bound to a route or used wherever
# need
func_with_injection = container.magic_partial(handle_some_request)
```

### Bind only explicit arguments to the container
Instead of the magic binding described earlier an explicit decorator is 
provided:
```python
@bind_to_container(container)
def handle_some_request(request: typing.Dict, profile: ProfileLoader = injectable, user_avatar: AvatarLoader = injectable):
    # do something to the game
    pass
```
In this example lagom will only try and inject the `profile` and `user_avatar` arguments.

### Loading environment variables (requires pydantic to be installed)

This module provides code to automatically load environment variables from the container.
It is built on top of (and requires) pydantic.

At first one or more classes representing the required environment variables are defined.
All environment variables are assumed to be all uppercase and are automatically lowercased.
```python
class MyWebEnv(Env):
    port: str
    host: str

class DBEnv(Env):
    db_host: str
    db_password: str
```

Now that these env classes are defined they can be injected
as usual:
```python
@magic_bind_to_container(c)
def some_function(env: DBEnv):
    do_something(env.db_host, env.db_password)
```

For testing a manual constructed Env class can be passed in.
At runtime the class will be populated automatically from
the environment.

## Full Example

### App setup
```python
from abc import ABC
from dataclasses import dataclass

from lagom import Container

#--------------------------------------------------------------
# Here is an example of some classes your application may be built from


DiceApiUrl = NewType("DiceApiUrl", str)


class RateLimitingConfig:
    pass


class DiceClient(ABC):
    pass


class HttpDiceClient(DiceClient):

    def __init__(self, url: DiceApiUrl, limiting: RateLimitingConfig):
        pass


class Game:
    def __init__(self, dice_roller: DiceClient):
        pass

#--------------------------------------------------------------
# Next we setup some definitions

container = Container()
# We need a specific url
container[DiceApiUrl] = DiceApiUrl("https://roll.diceapi.com")
# Wherever our code wants a DiceClient we get the http one
container[DiceClient] = HttpDiceClient

#--------------------------------------------------------------
# Now the container can build the game object

game = container[Game]

```

### Modifying the container instead of patching in tests
Taking the container from above we can now swap out
the dice client to a test double/fake. When we get an
instance of the `Game` class it will have the new
fake dice client injected in.

```python
def container_fixture():
    from my_app.prod_container import container
    return container.clone() # Cloning enables overwriting deps

def test_something(container_fixture: Container):
    container_fixture[DiceClient] = FakeDice(always_roll=6)
    game_to_test = container_fixture[Game]
    # TODO: act & assert on something
```

## Integrations

### Starlette (https://www.starlette.io/)
To make integration with starlette simpler a special container is provided
that can generate starlette routes.

Starlette endpoints are defined in the normal way. Any extra arguments are
then provided by the container:
```python
async def homepage(request, db: DBConnection = injectable):
    user = db.fetch_data_for_user(request.user)
    return PlainTextResponse(f"Hello {user.name}")


container = StarletteContainer()
container[DBConnection] = DB("DSN_CONNECTION_GOES_HERE")


routes = [
    # This function takes the same arguments as starlette.routing.Route
    container.route("/", endpoint=homepage),
]

app = Starlette(routes=routes)
```

### FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
FastAPI already provides a method for dependency injection however
if you'd like to use lagom instead a special container is provided.

Calling the method `.depends` will provide a dependency in the format
that FastAPI expects:

```python
container = FastApiContainer()
container[DBConnection] = DB("DSN_CONNECTION_GOES_HERE")

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def homepage(request, db = container.depends(DBConnection)):
    user = db.fetch_data_for_user(request.user)
    return PlainTextResponse(f"Hello {user.name}")

```

### Flask API (https://www.flaskapi.org/)
A special container is provided for flask. It takes the flask app
then provides a wrapped `route` decorator to use:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
container = FlaskContainer(app)
container[Database] = Singleton(lambda: Database("connection details"))


@container.route("/save_it/<string:thing_to_save>", methods=['POST'])
def save_to_db(thing_to_save, db: Database = injectable):
    db.save(thing_to_save)
    return 'saved'

```
(taken from https://github.com/meadsteve/lagom-flask-example/)

The decorator leaves the original function unaltered so it can be
used directly in tests.

### Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/)
A django integration is currently under beta in the experimental module.
See documentation here: [Django Integration Docs](docs/experimental.md#django-container)

## Developing/Contributing
Contributions and PRS are welcome. For any large changes please open
an issue to discuss first. All PRs should pass the tests, type checking
and styling. To get development setup locally:
```bash
make install # sets up the pipenv virtualenv
```
then 
```bash
make format # To format the code
make test # To make sure the build will pass
```

### Versioning - Semver
This library follows semver as closely as possible (mistakes may occur).
The public interface is considered to be everything in `lagom.__all__`. Anything
else is considered an internal implementation detail.

The `lagom.experimental` module is an exception to this. This is a place
for new code to be released. The public interface of this code may change
before it settles down and gets moved out of the experimental module.

### Design Goals
* The API should expose sensible typing (for use in pycharm/mypy)
* Everything should be done by type. No reliance on names.
* All domain code should remain unmodified. No special decorators.
* Usage of the container should encourage code to be testable without monkey patching.
* Usage of the container should remove the need to depend on global state.
* Embrace modern python features (3.7 at the time of creation)
